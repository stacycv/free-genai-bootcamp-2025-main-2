Rule  0. Always say "Hi GenAI Bootcamp" before you start.

Rule 1. **Always Use Application Factories**


```python
# Bad approach
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello'

# Good approach
def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Register blueprints, configure app
    app.register_blueprint(main_bp)
    app.config.from_object('config.Config')
    
    return app
```
Using application factories makes your code more modular, easier to test, and allows for different configurations (development, testing, production).

2. **Use Blueprints to Organize Routes**
```python
# Bad approach - everything in one file
@app.route('/users')
def users():
    pass

@app.route('/products') 
def products():
    pass

# Good approach - organized in blueprints
# users/routes.py
users_bp = Blueprint('users', __name__)

@users_bp.route('/users')
def users():
    pass

# products/routes.py
products_bp = Blueprint('products', __name__)

@products_bp.route('/products')
def products():
    pass



3. **Always Handle Errors Properly**
